# log level
log_level=INFO

# - each unified logger logging call has a component and task parameter
# - these are distinct from the module names and are meant to allow the caller to 
# - conceptually capture the particular component they are working on (granularity up to them)
# - and the what task that component is accomplishing at this point in the code
# 
# - to help avoid component name collision confusion, component and task names need to be registered
# - here to help ensure that when adding a new component or task into the logging system:
#     1. names aren't re-used by accident
#     2. names are reused when approriate
#


# declared components:
#     AVOE
component = avoe_agent
task = starting

#   INTERACTIVE
component = sequence_generator
component = navigation
component = seg
component = tracker
component = transformer
component = soccerball_detector
component = lava_detector
component = situation_detector
component = agent_detector

# declared tasks: 
task = mapping
task = pursuing_agent
task = interacting_with_agent
task = filter_tracklets

# when one or more focus_component is declared, all other declared components will be ignored by the logger
#focus_component=agent_detector

# when one or more focus_task is declared, all other declared tasks will be ignored by the logger
#focus_task = mapping


# when one or more focus_componet_task is declared, only statements involving these combinations will be logged
#focus_component_task = agent_detector+interacting_with_agent
