The OPICS evaluation 6 submission uses apptainer containers to contain the environments used by each of our three systems:

    AVOE - agency violation of expectation
    PVOE - phyics violaation of expectation
    INTER - interactive / retrieval

The three apptainer containers are located at


~/containers/avoe_040223_ev5_6new.sif
~/containers/pvoe_040123_eval5_cuda_11.sif
~/containers/inter_040323_5w_6new.sif


HOW TO RUN A SCENE

# run the main_optics alias to set headless mode and env variables 
%main_optics

# cd in to the scripts dir and run the unified launch script
%cd scripts
%python opics_eval6_run_scene.py --scene <path_to_scene_file>


This script uses the scene category to choose the appropriate container and then invokes

    apptainer run --nv <container path> run_opics_scene <scene_path>



Since apptainer containers are read only unless you bind directories in from the outside, we avoid the binding issue altogether
by copying our code image from the container at /image__<container_name> to ~/test__<container_name, so that it can be run in
writeable space (under the home dir). We are "in the container" environment-wise, but running code that is now outside the container.

Each time a scene is run, the ~/test__<container_name> area is purged and the /image__<container_name> image is copied afresh.


To inspect a container,

% apptainer shell <container path>
