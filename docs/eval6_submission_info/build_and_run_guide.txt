The OPICS evaluation 6 submission uses apptainer containers to contain the environments used by each of our three systems:

    AVOE - agency violation of expectation
    PVOE - phyics violaation of expectation
    INTER - interactive / retrieval

The three containers are located apptainer


~/containers/avoe_040223_5ev5_6new.sif
~/containers/pvoe_040123_eval5_cuda_11.sif
~/containers/inter_040223_5w_6new.sif


HOW TO RUN A SCENE

# run the main_optics alias to set headless mode and env variables 
%main_optics

# cd in to the scripts dir and run the unified launch script
%cd scripts
%python opics_eval6_run_scene.py --scene <path_to_scene_file>


This script uses the scene category to choose the appropriate container and then invokes

    apptainer run --nv <container path>
