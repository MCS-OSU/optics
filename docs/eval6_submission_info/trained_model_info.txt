MODEL TRAINING OVERVIEW FOR AGENCY VOE

The single model in play is a shape detector  that is reused (not retrained) from Eval4, trained with 'expected' 
scenes provided by TA2, as well as 'expected' and 'unexpected' scenes that were generated for eval 4, presumably using
a scene gen utility provided by TA2.

MODEL TRAINING OVERVIEW FOR PHYSICS VOE

All physics models were trained with either or both of the following:  
   -the PLAUSIBLE ONLY scenes from 5/6ths of the eval4 scenes (last 1/6th held out for testing)
   -1000 scenes of each PVOE scene type generated by the ile using slightly modified example yaml files 
    provided by TA2   
   -contrastive models were tuned using some number of the implausible scenes from the 5/6ths eval4 set
