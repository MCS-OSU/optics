MODEL LOCATIONS NOTE.  The model locations referenced below are relative paths.  The parent directory can be found 
either inside the apptainer container or in the runnable copy of the image that is under the home directory.

To find them in the apptainer container, start with :

cd ~/containers

INTER:
apptainer shell xyz.sif
cd /image_xyz

PVOE:
apptainer shell pvoe_040123_eval5_cuda_11.sif
cd /image_pvoe_040123_eval5_cuda_11

AVOE:
apptainer shell xyz.sif
cd /image_xyz


To find them under the home dir (this assumes a scene has already been run, causing the runnable image to be copied here), start with:

INTER
cd ~/xyz

PVOE
cd ~/pvoe_040123_eval5_cuda_11

AVOE
cd ~/xyz






MODEL TRAINING OVERVIEW FOR AGENCY VOE

The single model in play is a shape detector  that is reused (not retrained) from Eval4, trained with 'expected' 
scenes provided by TA2, as well as 'expected' and 'unexpected' scenes that were generated for eval 4, presumably using
a scene gen utility provided by TA2.

    - soccerball detector 

        The model was trained on various scenarios in which the soccer ball appears in different positions using scenes 
        generated with the ILE.

        location:     ./opics_inter/ckpts/vision/soccer_ball_detector.pth
        training set:  <training_set_dir>/soccerball_detector/soccer_detectron_training.zip

 

    - human detectron

        The model is trained on scenes generated by ILE, which include multiple instances of humans with varying appearances, 
        such as differences in skin tone, clothing, and distance, in order to predict the human agents present in the scenes.
